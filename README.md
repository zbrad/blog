# ZBlog Theme

This is a GitHub oriented Jekyll theme.  This is directly derived from the [HPSTR Jekyll Theme](http://mmistakes.github.io/hpstr-jekyll-theme).  I very much appreciated [mmistakes](http://github.com/mmistakes) work but still wanted to do some of my own tweaking.

## Getting Started

HPSTR takes advantage of Sass and data files to make customizing easier. These features require Jekyll 2.x and will not work with older versions of Jekyll.

To learn how to install and use this theme check out the [Setup Guide](https://mmistakes.github.io/hpstr-jekyll-theme/theme-setup/) for more information.
